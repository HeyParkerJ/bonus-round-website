TODO: {
	BUGS: {
		Lists are indented to the right more than they should be
	}
}

given a list of items, divide the toal number by 4 columns. The resulting number is the amount of items to put in each column. The remainder (which will be less than 4) is placed in the first, second, then third column as needed.

Problem: last three items on the list will be 'out of order' becuase the previous columns are already filled.
Solution: 
	items / 4 = columnSize

	for remainder


given 50 items

50 / 4 = 12
